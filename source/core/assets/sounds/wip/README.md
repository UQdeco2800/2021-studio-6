## Work In Progress Sound Assets

These are sound effect / music assets that are currently being worked in.
They may be implemented into the game, but may not be suitable without more work.

Such examples include:
- Volume of Sound Effects not matched with background music (maybe too loud or too soft)
- Length too long (which may impede other sound effects)
- Errors with the sampling process (such as noise)
